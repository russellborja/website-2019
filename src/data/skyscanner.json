    "description": "At Skyscanner, I was a member of the Web Infrastructure squad that was responsible for re-architecting the web platform from the ground up. Using OpenTable's Open Components technology, I created re-usable and maintainable Javascript libraries such as Google Analytics tracking that were consumed by all other front-end teams within the organization. I also contributed to the re-design of the website's visuals in 2017 during the company-wide \"spring clean\"."
