    "description": "During my last internship at Match Group, I was a member of the Emerging Brands team developing prototypical dating apps to quickly release to the market. I ideated, wire-framed, and designed the back-end of Chance, an iOS app that matched users that physically crossed paths and initiated conversations when certain compatibility criteria were met. This functionality was later implemented as a feature in the core match.com product."
